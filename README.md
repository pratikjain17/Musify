# Musify
This is a music rest api that helps us to do CRUD operations in song , artist and album table.

In this we have made a UI that will help us in doing the CRUD operation properly.
We have used Bootstrap for the UI and PHP SQL for backend.

It consists of the following -
index.php - where all the songs are listed
header.php - where we can search for a songs by its year of release,duration,name.
Here you can update,create and delete songs artists and albums.

Here are some of the screenshots of the UI -
